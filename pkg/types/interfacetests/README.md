This folder contains tests for interfaces that should be run by all implementations.

Note that this kind of testing is normally called *contract testing*, but that term is overloaded in the smartcontractkit repositories to refer to tests for smart contracts. As such, we will be calling it *interface testing*, although that term sometimes refers to a slightly different kind of test, we feel that it accurately represents what we are testing and will cause less confusion overall.
