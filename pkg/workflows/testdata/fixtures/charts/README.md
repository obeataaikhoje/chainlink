# WorkflowSpec Charts

This directory contains WorkflowSpec chart golden files. They are validated against test data by TestWorkflowSpecFormatChart, 
and can be regenerated by passing the `-update` flag:
```sh
go test -run=TestWorkflowSpecFormatChart ./pkg/workflows/sdk/ -update
```
You can also invoke go:generate on package sdk, which will do the same.
